what is the pdf analyzing application,"The PDF analyzing application is a tool that allows users to upload multiple PDFs and get answers to user-given quotations only from the user-uploaded PDFs. Unlike other LLM and AI models, this project application never answers with random data and only uses the uploaded PDF as the data source. This application can be launched on multiple platforms including Web, Android, iOS, and Desktop. It is powered by the Langchain platform and is capable of answering with relevant page numbers and PDF names. It can also summarize topics. The application can understand user-given quotations by using its integrated LLM (Large Language Model). When a user asks something that is not in the PDF, it will reply ""user answer is not in your context""."
